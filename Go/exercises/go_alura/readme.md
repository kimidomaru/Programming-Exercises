# Go Website Monitor (Alura Course Project)

This project is a simple website monitoring CLI tool written in Go, following the exercises and lessons from the [Alura Go course](https://www.alura.com.br/).

## üìö About

The program allows you to:
- Monitor a list of websites, checking if they are online or offline.
- Log the results of each check with timestamps.
- Display the monitoring logs.
- Exit the application via a simple menu.

The code is structured for beginners, focusing on Go fundamentals such as:
- Reading from and writing to files
- Using loops and conditionals
- Working with slices and strings
- Making HTTP requests
- Basic CLI interaction

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Menu**: When you run the program, you'll see a menu with options to monitor websites, display logs, or exit.
2. **Monitoring**: The program reads a list of websites from `websites.txt` and checks each one multiple times (configurable).
3. **Logging**: Each check result (online/offline) is appended to `logs.txt` with a timestamp.
4. **Logs**: You can view the monitoring history by selecting the "Display Logs" option.

## üìù Usage

1. **Prepare your website list**  
   Create a file named `websites.txt` in the same directory as the program. Add one website URL per line, for example:
   ```
   https://www.google.com
   https://www.github.com
   ```

2. **Run the program**  
   ```sh
   go run menu.go
   ```

3. **Follow the menu prompts**  
   - Enter `1` to start monitoring.
   - Enter `2` to display logs.
   - Enter `3` to exit.
